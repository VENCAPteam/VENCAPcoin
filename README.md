# VENCAPcoin

VENCAP is a blockchain project offering a new solution for Venture Capital tokenization. The VENCAP tokenization Protocol is a combination of smart contracts and legal structures offered as a turnkey solution to start-up funding market.

In phase one, existing company crowdfunding and securitization models are intended to be used. A trust will hold the shares of the Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV), which (partly) owns shares in the company, for the benefit of VENCAP token holders. Beneficial rights will be protected by the nominee agreement. In this case, the VENCAP token itself will represent the proof of being party to such an agreement. In others, VENCAP tokens can represent the shares in SPV without any trust structure. This requires the legal possibility to keep shareholders registries and the writing of share transfers on the blockchain.

In the second phase the platform will be launched expected Q3, 2021 ddecentralization elements will be tested and added to the Platform on a step-by-step basis. VENCAP blockchain development, community growth, and VENCAP token holders’ gradually increasing role in operations and governance are the foundation for the second phase. Any VENCAP token holder can upload smart contracts to the network. Such smart contracts are marked as “Under Development” until the contract validation process is passed. Quality assurance is initially performed by the VENCAP team and includes a legal framework compatibility check, the Platform-architecture compatibility check and a security check.

The Platform is based on the Command Query separation technique (write and read requests performed separately) and is divided into five basic logic layers: the Distributed Storage Layer, the Ethereum Ledger Layer, the Access Layer, the Interface Layer, and the Applications Layer, see white paper for more detailed info.


First stakes in start-ups will be made public for voting on 1 May 2021.
